Helo fren, I'm StickFix, I can link keywords with stickers so you can manage them more easily.
By default, all tags are public (everyone can access them), but you can also create your own _private collection_ of stickers.

You can use any word or even emojis as tags, so for example, you can link a sticker with the tag `hello`.
To use this bot, you simply have to call it inline like `@stickfixbot tag`, and it will show a list with all the stickers linked with `tag`.
You can also use more than one tag and the bot will search for all the stickers that have all those tags in common.

**You can control me by sending me these commands:**

`/add tags` - Links a sticker with one or more tags. For this to work you have to reply to a  message that contains a sticker with the command; I need access to the messages to do this.

`/deleteFrom tags` - Is similar to `/add`, but this removes a sticker from a tag.

`/setMode (private|public)` - Changes the user to public or private mode.
In private mode only you will be able to see the stickers you add; by default all users are in public mode.

`/shuffle (on|off)` - Turn this on if you want the stickers in inline mode to be shown in random order; it's off by default.

`/deleteMe` - If you want to be removed from the database.
This will erase all the stickers you added in private mode and can't be undone.
